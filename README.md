# A predictive framework based on brain volume trajectories enabling early detection of Alzheimer’s disease
- In this repository two main jupyter notebooks for our paper "A predictive framework based on brain volume trajectories enabling early detection of Alzheimer’s disease" are available.
- One file is the source code related to extracting features from longitudinal data by applying mixed effect models and the second one is for applying an Ensemble model for classification of patient with MCI versus who were converted to AD.
