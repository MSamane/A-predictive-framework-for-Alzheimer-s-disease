# A predictive framework based on brain volume trajectories enabling early detection of Alzheimer’s disease
- **In this repository two main jupyter notebooks for our paper "A predictive framework based on brain volume trajectories enabling early detection of Alzheimer’s disease" are available.**
  -  **First contains the source codes related to extracting features from longitudinal data by applying mixed effect models.** 
  - **Second  contains the source code for applying an Ensemble model for classification of patients with MCI versus who were converted form MCI to AD.**
